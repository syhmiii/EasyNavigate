# **Little Minds**

This is a simple project created by my friend and I, Luismika and Syahmi respectively. Kids definitely would love to have a fun and enjoyable time exploring websites. The main aim of this project is for little children to start learning their basic foundation in a simple and interactive way that helps them to gain more knowledge in a fun way.

This project also may potentially allow for more interactivity between the user and the website than other websites even though it is mainly for little children. This is because of how the website is made to look very attractive towards them and how easy to follow even if the child is not that familiar with websites.
